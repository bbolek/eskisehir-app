# Create Product Mission Workflow

**Agent:** @.bot/agents/product-planner.md

This workflow guides you through creating a clear, focused product mission document.

## Purpose

A product mission serves as the north star for development decisions. It:
- Clarifies what problem you're solving
- Defines who you're solving it for
- Establishes success criteria
- Guides feature prioritization

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of the problem space
- Knowledge of target users
- Product concept or vision

## Steps

### 1. Define the Vision

Write a 1-2 sentence vision statement:
- What is this product?
- What does it do?
- Why does it exist?

**Example:**
"A project management tool that helps remote teams coordinate work without meetings."

### 2. State the Problem

Clearly articulate the problem:
- What pain point exists?
- Who experiences this pain?
- How do they currently cope?
- Why existing solutions fall short?

### 3. Identify Target Users

Define primary and secondary user personas:
- Who are they?
- What do they need?
- What are their goals?
- What are their constraints?

### 4. Articulate Value Proposition

Explain why users should choose this:
- What unique value does it provide?
- How is it different from alternatives?
- What's the core benefit?

### 5. Establish Success Criteria

Define measurable success metrics:
- User acquisition goals
- Engagement metrics
- Business metrics
- Impact metrics
