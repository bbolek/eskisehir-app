## Code Commenting Best Practices

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- **Minimal, Helpful Comments**: Add concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of code logic
- **Explain Why, Not What**: Comments should explain why decisions were made, not what the code does (the code shows what)
- **Don't Comment Changes or Fixes**: Do not leave code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes. Comments should be evergreen informational texts that are relevant far into the future
- **Document Complex Logic**: Add comments for algorithms, business rules, or non-obvious implementation details
- **API Documentation**: Use doc comments for public APIs (e.g., JSDoc, XML docs, docstrings)
- **TODO Comments**: Use TODO comments sparingly and include ticket numbers or owner names
- **Remove Dead Code**: Delete commented-out code rather than leaving it in the codebase
- **Keep Comments Updated**: Update comments when code changes; outdated comments are worse than no comments
