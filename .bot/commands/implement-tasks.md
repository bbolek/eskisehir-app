# Implement Tasks Command

Implement features by working through a tasks list with proper verification.

## Description

This command guides you through implementing tasks from a tasks.md file. It ensures:
- Tasks are understood before implementation
- Code follows standards
- Tests are written
- Implementation is verified
- Progress is tracked

## When to Use

Use this command when you:
- Have a tasks.md file ready to implement
- Want structured guidance through implementation
- Need to ensure quality and standards compliance
- Want built-in verification steps

## Prerequisites

- Completed specification (spec.md)
- Task breakdown (tasks.md)
- Development environment set up
- Standards documented

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Tasks

If you don't already know which tasks to implement:
1. Ask user which spec/tasks file to work from
2. List available task groups
3. Confirm which tasks to implement

### Step 2: Implement Each Task

For each task in the tasks list:

#### A. Understand the Task
- Read the task description
- Review acceptance criteria
- Check the related spec section
- Identify dependencies
- Review relevant standards

#### B. Write Tests (TDD Approach)
- Write failing tests for expected behavior
- Cover happy path scenarios
- Cover edge cases
- Cover error conditions
- Follow testing standards

#### C. Implement the Solution
- Follow coding standards
- Keep code clean and simple
- Handle errors appropriately
- Add meaningful comments where needed
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

#### D. Make Tests Pass
- Run tests frequently
- Fix issues as they arise
- Refactor for clarity
- Ensure all tests pass

#### E. Manual Verification
- Test the feature manually
- Verify UI/UX if applicable
- Check edge cases
- Ensure it works in real scenarios

#### F. Self Code Review
- Check against coding standards
- Ensure no debug code remains
- Verify error handling
- Check for performance issues
- Confirm documentation is updated

### Step 3: Verify Implementation

Before marking task complete, verify:

✓ **Matches Spec**
- Implementation matches requirements
- Acceptance criteria are met
- No scope creep

✓ **Follows Standards**
- Coding style standards followed
- Error handling standards followed
- Validation standards followed
- Commenting standards followed

✓ **Test Coverage**
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests if needed
- Edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested

✓ **Quality Checks**
- Code is clean and maintainable
- No code smells
- Follows DRY principle
- Consistent with codebase

✓ **Documentation**
- Code comments where needed
- API docs updated
- README updated if needed
- CHANGELOG updated if applicable

### Step 4: Mark Task Complete

- Check off the task in tasks.md
- Update any related documentation
- Note any follow-up tasks
- Commit changes with clear message

## Output

For each implemented task:
- ✅ Working, tested code
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Task checked off in tasks.md
- ✅ Quality verified
- ✅ Standards followed

## Standards

This command follows:
- `.bot/standards/global/coding-style.md`
- `.bot/standards/global/error-handling.md`
- `.bot/standards/global/validation.md`
- `.bot/standards/global/commenting.md`
- `.bot/standards/global/conventions.md`
- Any project-specific standards

## Workflow

This command follows:
- `.bot/workflows/implementation/implement-tasks.md`

## Best Practices

**Work Incrementally**
- Implement one task at a time
- Commit frequently
- Test as you go

**Maintain Quality**
- Don't skip tests
- Don't ignore linting errors
- Don't compromise standards

**Communicate**
- Ask questions when unclear
- Flag blockers early
- Update task status regularly

**Handle Blockers**
- Document the blocker
- Try workarounds
- Work on other tasks if blocked
- Communicate to team

## How to Use

In Warp AI, press **Ctrl-Shift-R** and select:
```
dotbot-implement-tasks
```

Provide the task group to implement and this workflow will:
1. Read the tasks from tasks.md
2. Implement each task with tests
3. Verify acceptance criteria are met
4. Follow all coding standards
5. Mark tasks as completed

## Tips

- Read the full spec before starting
- Understand acceptance criteria clearly
- Write tests before implementation
- Keep commits small and focused
- Refactor as you go
- Don't accumulate technical debt
- Ask for clarification early
- Document decisions and trade-offs
